This web app puts the student's name in a tutoring waiting queue based on the course selection and availability of a tutor.  This helps students to be aware of a number of people waiting for a specific subject tutor on their college or university.  If the number of students waiting for a specific tutor exceeds the limit, the app gives the capability to students to know the tutor will be unavailable for the time period he/she is working. This version is designed only for California State University, Sacramento College of Engineering and Computer Science.  In future, we plan to include more universities and departments.
